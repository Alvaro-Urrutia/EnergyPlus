   ************* Beginning Zone Sizing Calculations
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 5 nominally unused constructions in input.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each unused construction, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ** Warning ** SetUpZoneSizingArrays: Sizing for Zone="SPACE2-1" will use Sizing:Zone specifications listed for Zone="SPACE1-1".
   ** Warning ** Calculated design cooling load for zone=SPACE2-1 is zero.
   **   ~~~   ** Check Sizing:Zone and ZoneControl:Thermostat inputs.
   ** Warning ** Calculated design heating load for zone=SPACE2-1 is zero.
   **   ~~~   ** Check Sizing:Zone and ZoneControl:Thermostat inputs.

   ** Severe  ** Node Connection Error, Node="SPACE2-1 IN NODE", ZoneInlet node did not find an outlet node.
   **   ~~~   ** Reference Object=ZONEHVAC:EQUIPMENTCONNECTIONS, Name=SPACE2-1
   ** Severe  ** Node Connection Error, Node="SPACE2-1 IN NODE", Inlet node did not find an appropriate matching "outlet" node.
   **   ~~~   ** If this is an outdoor air inlet node, it must be listed in an OutdoorAir:Node or OutdoorAir:NodeList object.

   ************* ===== Final Error Summary =====
   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* Node Connection Errors
   ************* ..Node connection errors are often caused by spelling mistakes in a node name field.
   ************* ..To track down the problem, search the idf file for each node name listed to see if it
   ************* ..occurs in the expected input fields.
   ************* Nominally Unused Constructions
   ************* ..The nominally unused constructions warning is provided to alert you to potential conditions that can cause
   ************* ..extra time during simulation. Each construction is calculated by the algorithm indicated in the HeatBalanceAlgorithm
   ************* ..object. You may remove the constructions indicated (when you use the DisplayExtraWarnings option).
